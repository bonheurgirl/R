##Here is a very small function, priceCalculator(), that calculates the price you charge to a customer based on the hours of work you did for that customer. The function should take the number of hours (hours) and the price per hour (pph) as input. 
priceCalculator <- function(hours, pph=40){
    net.price <- hours * pph
    round(net.price)
}

##calling the function by inputting 6 hours worked. both of these below will spit out the same calculation
> priceCalculator(6)
[1] 240

> priceCalculator(6, pph=40)
[1] 240

##here is what happens when you want to change the amount of pph(pay per hour) without having to rewrite your entire function
> priceCalculator(6,pph=50)
[1] 300

##Hereâ€™s what the priceCalculator does:

##With the function keyword, you define the function.

##Everything between the braces is the body of the function (see Chapter 8).

##Between the parentheses, you specify the arguments hours (without a default value) and pph (with a default value of $40 per hour).

##You calculate the net price by multiplying hours by pph.

##The outcome of the last statement in the body of your function is the returned value. In this case, this is the total price rounded to the dollar.
