colors()

The first, colorRamp, takes a palette of colors (the arguments) and returns a function that takes values between 0 and 1 as arguments. The 0 and 1 correspond to the extremes of the color palette. Arguments between 0 and 1 return blends of these extremes.
```{r}
pal<-colorRamp(c("red", "blue"))
pal(0)
```
