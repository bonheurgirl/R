Can we find things that are close together?

1. how do we define close?
2. how do we group things?
3. how do we visualize the grouping?
4. how do we interpret the grouping?

Most important step
garbage in====garbage out


Distance or similarity
        continuous-euclidian distance
        continuous--correlation similarity
        binary--manhattan distance

pick a distance/similarity that makes sense for our problem


K means clustering
* a partitioning approach
        -fix a number of clusters
        -get centroids of each cluster
        -assign things to closest centroid
        -recalculate centroids
* requires
        -a defined distance metric
        -a number of clusters
        -an initial guess as to cluster centroids
* produces
        -final estimate of cluster centroids
        -an assigment of each point to clusters
